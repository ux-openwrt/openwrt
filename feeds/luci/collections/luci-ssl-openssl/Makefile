LUCI_TITLE:=LuCI with HTTPS support (OpenSSL as SSL backend)
LUCI_DESCRIPTION:=LuCI with OpenSSL as the SSL backend (libustream-openssl). \
 Note: px5g still requires libmbedtls (in LEDE) or libpolarssl (in Openwrt). \
 In LEDE it is also possible to replace px5g with openssl-util as uhttpd can \
 also generate keys with openssl commandline tools if px5g is not installed.
